    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biryani is an evergreen classic that really needs no introduction. India offers so much on its culinary platter but the one dish Indians unanimously love indulging in is the mouth-watering biryani. With local and hyperlocal variations having evolved into distinctive styles of biryanis, one is spoilt for options when it comes to experiencing this melting pot of flavours.</p>
    <p>The perfect biryani calls for meticulously measured ingredients and a practised technique. Traditionally, the dum pukht method (slow breathing oven in Persian) was used to make biryani. In this method, the ingredients are loaded in a pot and slow-cooked over charcoal, sometimes from the top also, to allow the dum or steam to works its magic. The pot, sealed around the edges with dough, allows the steaming meat to tenderise in its own juices while flavouring the rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Biriyani Masala</li>
        <li>Curry Powder</li>
        <li>Red Chilli Powder</li>
        <li>Coriander Leaves</li>
        <li>Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>Mint Leaves</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Green Chillies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients: basmati rice, meat (chicken, mutton, or vegetables), onions, tomatoes, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani spices (like cumin, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves), saffron, and fresh herbs (like mint and coriander).</li>
        <li>Soak the basmati rice in water for about 30 minutes to an hour. This helps the rice cook evenly.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil or ghee and sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnishing later.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and chopped tomatoes to the pot, cooking until the tomatoes soften. Then, add the meat or vegetables along with yogurt and biryani spices. Cook until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, boil water and add the soaked rice. Cook until the rice is about 70% done, then drain the water.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture in the pot. Sprinkle saffron soaked in warm milk and the reserved fried onions on top. Cover the pot tightly and cook on low heat for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
