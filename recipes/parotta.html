    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Parotta or Porotta is a beloved layered, flaky flatbread made from Maida or Atta flour. This delectable dish is a staple in Kerala and Tamil areas of Sri Lanka and has spread across other South Indian states. Its popularity has even reached international shores, becoming a common sight in countries like Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. One of the most famous pairings is Parotta and beef fry, a cherished combination in Kerala.</p>
    <p>Parottas are not just confined to restaurant menus; they are a popular street food, served hot and fresh by vendors in bustling markets. They are also a common feature at weddings, religious festivals, and feasts, showcasing their cultural significance. The preparation involves kneading Maida or wheat flour with egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee, and water. The dough is then beaten into thin layers, spiraled into a ball, rolled flat, and pan-fried to perfection. Parottas are typically served with a variety of meat curries, such as chicken, goat, beef, or lamb, enhancing their savory appeal.</p>
